Bobby Context v3.0 — October 2025

Project: MobyDick Engine
Type: Custom C++ 2D/2.5D Game Engine
Games: MortalRecon (legacy), Bobby’s Burden (active)

🔧 Architecture

Modular engine: Core, Render, RendererGL, Audio (future RendererVulkan).

Built as a static library (MobyDickEngine) via CMake.

Shared via git submodule for cross-platform games.

⚙️ Build System

Uses CMake + vcpkg.json for dependencies: SDL2, Box2D, EnkiTS, ImGui, glm, glad, jsoncpp.

Each platform defines:

MOBYDICK_PLATFORM_WINDOWS

MOBYDICK_PLATFORM_ANDROID

MOBYDICK_PLATFORM_IOS

Platform-specific code gated by EnginePlatform.h.

Games use add_subdirectory(MobyDick) + target_link_libraries().

🎨 Rendering

SDL2 used only for window, input, audio.

Rendering handled by custom OpenGL backend (RendererGL implementing IRenderer).

Future goal: optional Vulkan renderer.

2D sprites rendered as quads in 3D space (orthographic projection).

Lighting and shadow-mapping pipeline for true 3D lighting in 2D scenes.

🧩 Components

ShaderManager, Material, FrameBufferObject (FBO) planned.

Batching and material sorting for efficiency.

Physics remains 2D-only (Box2D v3).

🚀 Cross-Platform Plan

Windows first (vcpkg native).

Android/iOS next via CMake toolchains.

Shared engine repo (MobyDick_NEW) versioned per game branch/tag.

🧭 Current Focus

Finalize CMake + vcpkg integration on Windows.

Modularize engine libs.

Expand OpenGL renderer with shaders/materials/FBOs.

Implement lighting + shadows.

Test Android/iOS builds.
